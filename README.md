Abstract
Antibiotics place bacterial pathogens under intense pressure to evolve new survival mechanisms. Genomic analysis of 51,229 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) clinical isolates identified an essential transcriptional regulator, Rv1830, here named resR, as a frequent target of positive (adaptive) selection. resR mutations do not cause canonical drug resistance or drug tolerance but instead shorten the post-antibiotic effect – meaning they enable Mtb to resume growth after drug exposure significantly faster than wildtype strains, a phenotype which we term antibiotic resilience. ResR acts in a regulatory cascade with other transcription factors controlling cell growth and division, which are also under positive selection in Mtb clinical isolates. In clinical populations, mutations in these genes are associated with treatment failure and the acquisition of canonical drug resistance.
